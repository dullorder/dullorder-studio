## Studio Purpose

DullOrder Studio was created to honor and preserve original creative works through blockchain mint records.

Each artwork is independently created and first published through official channels.  
Blockchain mint timestamps act as primary creation evidence, while this repository provides a supporting public documentation layer.

Primary minting activity is currently conducted on **Base blockchain**.  
Future cross-chain publication may occur if officially announced.

## Authorship & Originality Basis

Originality is supported by:

1. First mint blockchain timestamps  
2. Public mint record pages  
3. Official blog publication timestamps  
4. GitHub repository timestamps  
5. Cross-platform identity consistency  

Primary authenticity verification remains on-chain.
