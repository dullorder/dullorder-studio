# Originality Declaration — DullOrder Studio

DullOrder Studio declares that all artworks published under its collections are original works created independently.

Covered collections:

• DullOrder — 2D  
• CalmUnion — 3D  
• OmBrow — Realistic  

Originality support evidence includes:

1. First mint blockchain timestamps  
2. Public mint record pages  
3. Official blog publication timestamps  
4. GitHub repository timestamps  
5. Cross-platform identity consistency  

Blockchain mint records remain the primary authenticity proof.

This repository acts as a supporting public authorship documentation layer.
